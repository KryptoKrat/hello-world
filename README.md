# Hello-WORLD! An entrepreneural spirit describes me. I desire to develop. I've heard it said... "That the new illiterate will be the people who won't unlearn to learn, and relearn." Well, that would not be me. I passionately dive deep studying cryptography and blockchain technology,  In a nutshell, I'm a perpetual, passionately driven 
lifetime student and excited for the blockchain disruption era. Yay...bring it on...!!!
